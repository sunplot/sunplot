### Quickstart

To build the project, make sure you have Node.js installed (at least version 6)
and then `npm install` to install the dependencies.
To run you will need to have both the backend and frontend running, simply
type `npm start` to start the frontend.
Open a new terminal and navigate to the backend directory, once in the directory
type `npm start`. The backend server will start on port 9090 and the frontend
can be accessed from http://localhost:3000/
